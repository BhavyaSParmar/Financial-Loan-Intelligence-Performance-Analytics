# Financial-Loan-Intelligence-Performance-Analytics
This project uses advanced data analytics and visualization in **Tableau** to deliver real-time insights into bank loan performance. Critical metrics like loan applications, funded amounts, and repayment rates are dynamically calculated using **custom SQL queries**, enabling optimized loan strategies, risk assessment, and data-driven decision-making.

### Dashboard Overview:
- **Executive Summary**: Displays key KPIs such as Total Loan Applications, Funded Amounts, Received Amounts, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income Ratio.
- **Loan Performance Analysis**: Differentiates "Good" vs. "Bad" loans, highlighting fully paid, charged-off, and current loans.
- **Geospatial Insights**: Maps loan distribution by states, purpose, and borrower demographics for regional and operational insights.

### Key Technical Features:
- **Automated KPI Calculation**: Dynamic computation of critical metrics using SQL for real-time updates.
- **Advanced Data Modeling**: Data preprocessing to ensure accuracy across loan categories.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Action-oriented dashboards with filtering options for granular data exploration.
- **Geospatial Analytics**: Geographic visualizations to assess regional loan performance.
- **Drilldowns**: Sophisticated filters for segment-specific insights.

### Tools & Technologies:
- **Tableau**: For interactive dashboards and real-time data visualization.
- **SQL**: For querying and aggregating data to drive key business metrics.
- **Python**: For ETL processes ensuring clean, structured data.
